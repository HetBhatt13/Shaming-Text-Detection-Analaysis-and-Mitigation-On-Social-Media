# Shaming-Text-Detection-Analaysis-and-Mitigation-On-Social-Media
In this Web application, we detect Shaming tweets and classify it in specific category. we have four categories 1. Abusive 2. Passing Judgement 3.Comparitive 4.Religious. And If same user does the shaming tweets more than three times then he will get block automatically and only admin can unblock him. Here, we have tried three algorithms 1.Naive Bayes 2.KNN 3.Random Forest for detection and classification of tweets. Among this algorithms Random Forest gave us better accuracy and this accuracy is also better than Support Vector Machine algorithm which is in existing algorithm. This is prototype project so it is not giving 100% accuracy.
